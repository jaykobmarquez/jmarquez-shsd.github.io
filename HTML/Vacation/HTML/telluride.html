		<h1> Telluride, Colorado </h1>
		<h2> What is it? </h2>
		<p>The Telluride Ski Resort is located in the southwest corner of Colorado. The resort is in the northwestern San Juan Mountains, part of the Rocky Mountains, and is home to the highest concentration of 13,000 and 14,000 foot peaks in North America. Telluride Ski Resort has over 2,000 skiable acres and spans between the historic town of Telluride, Colorado and the modern alpine community of Mountain Village, Colorado.</p>
		<h4> Why I want to go there </h4>
		<p> I love to ski with my family, I have been told it is a cool experience. not only that but I could also visit some family and bond while skiing with them. Would be a great way to get better at skiing and enjoying the weather in a different state like Colorado. </p>
