		<h1> Roatan, Honduras </h1>
		<h2> What is it? </h2>
		<p>Located near the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, the largest barrier reef in the Caribbean Sea (second largest worldwide after Australia's Great Barrier Reef), Roatan has become an important cruise ship and scuba diving destination in Honduras.</p>
		<h4> Why I want to go there </h4>
		<p> It would be like home to me, it is from my families home country. The waters are clear and it seems like a beautiful tropical experience. Great foods, and nice people to meet. On top of that it would be a great way to meet with some family and bond as we only see them once every few years.
